# neural-network-challenge
This repository contains the attrition.ipynb solutions to challenge #19.
The goal of this project is to use a neural network to build a model to predict the retention of employees and to figure out which departments may be better suited for an individual. 

The notebook imports the data from attrition.csv and uses 11 features ( Education, Age, Distance From Home, Job Satisfaction, Over Time, Stock Option Level, Work Life Balance, Years At Company, Years Since Last Promotion, Number of Companies Worked, Hourly Rate) and two dependent variables (department and attrition) to build the model. The data was split into training and testing sets, before the overtime columns were one hot encoded to transform the yes/no to 1/0.  The features were then all scaled and the department and attrition columns one hot encoded. A model was built with one input layer and two shared hidden layers between the two dependent variables.  An additional hidden and output layer were used to complete the model. The model was compiled using the binary cross entropy to calculate losses, adam as the optimizer an aiming for the accuracy as the metric to determine the performance of the model. The model was able to predict > 98% accuracy for both dependent variables, but resulted in a significantly lower accuracy for the testing data (57% 76%, for the department and attrition predictions). This may suggest that the data is being overfitted.
